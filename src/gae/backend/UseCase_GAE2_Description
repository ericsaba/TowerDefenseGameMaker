Use Case for Graphical Authoring Environment 2:
- User creates a new level

1. User clicks "Create new level"
2. GameManager calls its method "addNewLevel()" and creates a new LevelManager class, and adds itself to the list of LevelManagers.
3. When the LevelManager class is instantiated, a Level class is also created.
4. Because this is an Editable, the EditorView should recognize this and display its editable attributes
