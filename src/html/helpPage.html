<h2><b>Instructions on how to use the Graphical Authoring Environment:</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>Click Add Level</li>
<li>Click on the level in the tab</li>
</ol> 
<b>How to create an object:</b>
<ol>
<li>To create an object, click on the right box &quot;Generic Object&quot; and double-click on a specific type of object </li>
<li>Fill out the information - for now we can only put the name, label (which is just Tower or Enemy) and image path (ex. /images/ArcaneTower.png)</li>
<li>Click add</li>
<li>If you go to the pane on the very left, you should be able to see your tower with your name on it. Right-click to create a new instance, and place anywhere on the grid</li>
<li>Press the Escape button to stop creating new instances.</li>
</ol>
<b>How to make a path:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Path TitledPane on the left. Buttons on the right should now be enabled. </li>
<li>Click on &quot;Make Path&quot; and click once to select the starting point of the Path object and click again to select the ending point. There will now be four circles, the green being the starting point, the red being the ending point, and the other two being control points. You can shift these around to create whatever shape you&#39;d like.</li>
<li>When you&#39;re done adding paths, click &quot;Path Complete&quot;. This will add this path to the list on the left, which you can go back to and edit. If you do make an edit, press &quot;Update Path&quot; to make sure the information is updated.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;New Path&quot; if you want to create a new path.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Display Paths&quot; if you are done making the paths and would like to write them to an XML file, which can be used by the Game Player.</li>
</ol>
<b>How to delete objects:</b>
<ol>
<li>For paths, if you hover over a specific segment, it will be highlighted yellow. If you press the delete button, it will delete the object.</li>
<li>For game objects (such as tower), if you select the desired object on the left pane (the object will glow to show it is selected) and press the delete button, it will delete the object. </li>
</ol>
<b>How to drag objects:</b>
<ol>
<li>For game objects, when the object is selected (glowing object), you can drag it with your mouse to place it anywhere within the bounds of the board.</li>
</ol>
<b>How to change the background:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click on the &quot;Change Background&quot; button on the left. Pretty self-explanatory.</li>
</ol>
