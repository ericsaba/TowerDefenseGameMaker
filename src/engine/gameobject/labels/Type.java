/**
 * Forms the basic for a dynamic, user-defined typing system. Since the engine is built with only
 * one concrete GameObject, we need a way to tell GameObjects apart. Type is the solution, as the
 * user can set and get
 * a string representing the name. Futhermore, Type supports being built in a tree format, as you
 * can set super types to each Type
 * ( and the concrete implementations of Type could potentially keep track of their subtypes). This
 * allows you to set up systems of
 * Type inheritance where you make sub and super Types for each Type.
