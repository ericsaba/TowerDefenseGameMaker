 *
 *         Simple implementation of Type that allows for the tree structure of inheritance to exist.
 *         Overrides hashcode and equals methods to allow for any types with the same string name
 *         that inherit from types
 *         with the string name that inherit from types with the string name... to be equal.
 *         This happened because in order to give something a certain type, you have to create a new
 *         version
 *         of that type. They can't be constants because they are created by the user.
 *         By default, has TypeBase as the super type.
