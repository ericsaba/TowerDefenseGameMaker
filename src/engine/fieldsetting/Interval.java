/**
 * This annotation is used to mark a Settable method that should take in a number that is
 * an element of a certain interval. For instance, if you have a setRadius method, and you don't
 * want the
 * radius to be negative, you could set the lowerBound to zero. The game authoring environment will
 * then be able
 * to grab the interval at runtime and restrict the user to setting a value in that interval.
